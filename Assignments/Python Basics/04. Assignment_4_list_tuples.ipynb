    "##### 1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "It denotes the `list` in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the third value? (Assume `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "Third value would be the `2` index for the list. So it will be \n",
    "`spam[2] = 'hello'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let&#39;s pretend the spam includes the list [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. What is the value of `spam[int(int(&#39;3&#39; * 2) / 11)]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "The inner expression for index evalualtes to `3`, hence `spam[3]` would be `'d'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. What is the value of `spam[-1]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`spam[-1]` is `'d'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. What is the value of `spam[:2]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "`['a', 'b']`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let&#39;s pretend bacon has the list [3.14, &#39;cat,&#39; 11, &#39;cat,&#39; True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. What is the value of `bacon.index(&#39;cat&#39;)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "\n",
    "index of first `'cat'` is `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. How does `bacon.append(99)` change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`append` function adds a new element at the end of the list, hence the spam list would look like `[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 8. How does `bacon.remove(&#39;cat&#39;)` change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "remove function removes the first element found in the list, hence the list would look like `[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`+` can be used for conctenate and `*` can be used for replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10. What is difference between the list methods `append()` and `insert()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`append()` always adds a new element at the end of the list whereas the `insert()` insert at the index value provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`remove()`, `pop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`string` can be interpreted as the list of characters and most of the `list` operations can be performed over the `string` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 13. What&#39;s the difference between `tuples` and `lists`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`list` are mutable and `tuples` are not, hence some of the functions called on the list can change the list while funcion called on the tuples returns the new tuple object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans, \n",
    "`x = (42,)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "`t = tuple(list_x)`,\n",
    "\n",
    "`l = list(t_x)` where `list_x` is a list and `t_x` is a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "They contains the reference of the memory location of each element of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. \n",
    "For a nested list or a complex list `copy.copy()` functon make a new object and insert the reference elements in the original list. Hence if the elemets of original list are updated the shallow copied object will also be updated. \n",
    "Whereas in `copy.deepcopy()`, a new object is created with a seperate copy of all the nested elements inserted into it with no relation/connection wiht the original list object."
