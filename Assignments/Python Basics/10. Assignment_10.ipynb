    "#### 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shutil module** included in Python’s standard utility modules provides many functions of high-level operations on files and collections of files. This module helps in automating process of copying and removal of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods `shutil.copy()` & `shutil.copytree()` takes 2 parameters, source and destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copy()` method in Python is used to copy the content of source file to destination file or directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copytree()` method recursively copies an entire directory tree rooted at source (src) to the destination directory. The destination directory, named by (dst) must not already exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "`os.rename()` function is used to rename the file. It takes 2 arguments `src` for the source file name whose name is to be changed and `dest` is the new name to change to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using send2trash, we can send files to the Trash or Recycle Bin instead of permanently deleting them. This can be called by `send2trash.send2trash()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Shututil provides a function `shutil.rmtree()` to delete directory and all its content. Directory deleted with this funtion cannot be recovered back. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans."
