    "#### Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "**Ans.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error handling: One of the primary applications of exception processing is to handle errors that may occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions allow you to catch and handle errors at runtime, making it easier to detect and recover from issues that would otherwise cause your program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource management: Exception processing can also be used to manage resources that are acquired dynamically, such as file handles or database connections. You can use exception handling to ensure that resources are properly acquired, used, and released, even if an error occurs during the execution of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Input validation: Exception processing can be used to validate user input and ensure that it meets certain conditions or constraints. For example, you can use exception handling to ensure that user input is of a certain type or falls within a certain range, and provide appropriate error messages if the input is not valid.\n"

    "#### Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "**Ans.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is raised and not handled in your code, it will propagate up the call stack until it is caught by an exception handler or until it reaches the top-level of the program, where it will result in a system-generated error message and the termination of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a piece of code raises an exception and there is no try-except block in the same function to catch the exception, the exception will be propagated up the call stack to the calling function. If the calling function also doesn't have a try-except block to handle the exception, the exception will continue to propagate up the call stack until it is either caught or reaches the top-level of the program, where it will cause the program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to handle exceptions in your code can result in unpredictable behavior and can make it difficult to diagnose and fix problems. Therefore, it is important to catch and handle exceptions in a timely manner, so that you can gracefully recover from any errors that may occur during the execution of your program.\n"

    "#### Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "**Ans.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options for recovering from an exception in a Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try-except block: One of the most common ways to handle exceptions is by using a try-except block. This allows you to wrap a piece of code that may raise an exception and catch the exception if it is raised, so that you can recover from the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exception handling functions: You can also handle exceptions by defining exception handling functions, such as finally, that run whenever an exception is raised. The finally function is particularly useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing files or releasing memory, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Re-raising exceptions: In some cases, you may want to catch an exception, perform some action, and then re-raise the exception to be caught and handled elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logging exceptions: You can also log exceptions to a file or a remote service, so that you can diagnose and fix problems more easily. Logging exceptions can also help you track the number and types of exceptions that occur in your code over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Returning error codes: Another option is to return an error code or message from a function or method, indicating that an error has occurred. This allows the calling code to handle the error in a way that is appropriate for its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appropriate option for recovering from an exception depends on the specific requirements of your code and the nature of the exception. However, by using one or more of these options, you can handle exceptions in a way that allows you to gracefully recover from errors and avoid crashing your program."

    "#### Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "**Ans.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main methods for triggering exceptions in a Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Raising exceptions: One of the most common ways to trigger exceptions is by explicitly raising them using the \"raise\" keyword. You can raise exceptions when you detect that a condition that should not occur has occurred, such as a division by zero, an index out of range, or a missing file. When you raise an exception, the program execution immediately stops and the exception is propagated up the call stack until it is caught by an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Built-in exceptions: Another way to trigger exceptions is by causing a built-in exception to occur. For example, attempting to access an index that is out of range of a list will raise an \"IndexError\" exception, and attempting to divide by zero will raise a \"ZeroDivisionError\" exception. In these cases, the exceptions are triggered automatically, without the need for explicit raising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods are useful for handling errors and exceptional conditions in your code, and they are often used together to provide a complete exception handling mechanism. By using a combination of explicit raising and built-in exceptions, you can ensure that your code is robust and able to handle a wide range of errors and exceptional conditions in an organized and efficient manner."

    "#### Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "**Ans.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time in Python, regardless of whether or not an exception exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the \"finally\" clause: The \"finally\" clause is a special clause in Python that is used to specify code that should always be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. The code in the \"finally\" clause is executed after any code in the \"try\" block and any code in the \"except\" block(s), and it is guaranteed to be executed, even if a return statement or an uncaught exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using context managers: A context manager is an object that defines the methods `\"enter\"` and `\"exit\"`, which are used to specify the actions to be executed when entering and leaving a context. When using a context manager, you can specify actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception exists, by defining the `\"exit\"` method. This method is called automatically when the context is exited, even if an exception is raised, and it can be used to clean up resources, close files, and perform other tasks that need to be executed at termination time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods are useful for specifying actions to be executed at termination time in a clean and organized manner, and they provide a way to ensure that resources are cleaned up and other necessary tasks are performed, even if an exception occurs."
